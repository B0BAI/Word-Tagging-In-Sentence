While working at Ericsson as a Software Engineer Intern, I was part of the Auto Provisioning team, where I fixed the automation processes of 5G nodes. The principle role was to develop a solution to automate provisioning of 5G nodes. With this solution, field engineers wouldn’t have to physically go to the networks site to provision a 5G node.

When I  joined this team as an intern, the project was at its completion stage, I observed how my team members were working without the full context of the current problem. The solution they had wasn’t solving the issue we were facing, but rather, it was creating a totally new one. For example, generating artifacts and other network configuration were all done manually, the whole objective was to automate these processes. I spent my first few weeks reading documentation to better understand the problem and researched various solutions we could implement. This was al
