In the meantime, Muhammad Ali also looked southward, into Sudan: in the early 1820s, a series of campaigns saw Egyptian forces overcoming the Funj sultanate, as well as the last remnants of Mameluke opposition. In 1824, the Egyptian capital was established at Khartoum, where the Blue and White Niles meet. Further southward incursions would continue in the decades to come, toward Kordofan and into the Nuba mountains, while Khartoum-based traders and soldiers would reach as far as the lacustrine kingdoms of East Africa by the 1860s and 1870s; Egyptian rule of Sudan was only shattered by the Mahdist revolt in the 1880s, examined in Chapter 7. Importantly, the Egyptian presence in both Sudan and the Red Sea facilitated an <b>expansion</b> of trade, with many becoming rich on the proceeds of the regional slave and ivory trades along the Nile, fed by incursions into south Sudan, and the eastward-bound commerce on the Red Sea, increasingly used by Europeans as a route to India and East Asia. Egyptian <b>expansion</b> in Sudan would also lead to conflict with the other great expanding state in the region, namely Ethiopia under emperors Tewodros and Yohannes. In time, it was the commercial and strategic importance of the Red Sea to the British in particular which would be the undoing of the independent Egypt created by Muhammad Ali – and for this reason he consistently opposed the building of a canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean; but even before this, he was a cause for concern in European capitals, where he was perceived as becoming over-mighty and a threat to stability in the region. The British, moreover, had committed themselves to the defense and maintenance of the ever-weakening Ottoman empire, and Muhammad Ali needed to be brought to heel. It was Muhammad Ali’s <b>expansion</b> into the Levant in the early 1830s that caused great anxiety in Istanbul: an Ottoman expedition dispatched in 1839 to wrest the provinces of Syria and Palestine from Egyptian control ended in defeat and humiliation for the sultan, at which point Britain and several European allies stepped in to force Muhammad Ali to withdraw. In the late 1830s and early 1840s, he had his wings clipped even further when he was forced to reduce the size of his army – from close to 200,000 men to some 18,000 – and to end the monopolies he had set up which excluded Europeans from Egyptian markets. This effectively ended Muhammad Ali’s industrial ambitions, and from the 1840s onward the Egyptian economy became both largely agricultural and exposed to ever greater European influence and indeed management. The Egypt he had created was only partially “modernized,” limited by European wariness of this “oriental despot” and prone to European intervention; it was a pattern which was repeated across Islamic North Africa, and ultimately caused a profound cleavage within Islam itself.

It was Muhammad Ali’s <b>expansion</b> into the Levant in the early 1830s that caused great anxiety in Istanbul: an Ottoman expedition dispatched in 1839 to wrest the provinces of Syria and Palestine from Egyptian control ended in defeat and humiliation for the sultan, at which point Britain and several European allies stepped in to force Muhammad Ali to withdraw. In the late 1830s and early 1840s, he had his wings clipped even further when he was forced to reduce the size of his army – from close to 200,000 men to some 18,000 – and to end the monopolies he had set up which excluded Europeans from Egyptian markets. This effectively ended Muhammad Ali’s industrial ambitions, and from the 1840s onward the Egyptian economy became both largely agricultural and exposed to ever greater European influence and indeed management. The Egypt he had created was only partially “modernized,” limited by European wariness of this “oriental despot” and prone to European intervention; it was a pattern which was repeated across Islamic North Africa, and ultimately caused a profound cleavage within Islam itself.       In the meantime, Muhammad Ali also looked southward, into Sudan: in the early 1820s, a series of campaigns saw Egyptian forces overcoming the Funj sultanate, as well as the last remnants of Mameluke opposition. In 1824, the Egyptian capital was established at Khartoum, where the Blue and White Niles meet. Further southward incursions would continue in the decades to come, toward Kordofan and into the Nuba mountains, while Khartoum-based traders and soldiers would reach as far as the lacustrine kingdoms of East Africa by the 1860s and 1870s; Egyptian rule of Sudan was only shattered by the Mahdist revolt in the 1880s, examined in Chapter 7. Importantly, the Egyptian presence in both Sudan and the Red Sea facilitated an <b>expansion</b> of trade, with many becoming rich on the proceeds of the regional slave and ivory trades along the Nile, fed by incursions into south Sudan, and the eastward-bound commerce on the Red Sea, increasingly used by Europeans as a route to India and East Asia.

In the meantime, Muhammad Ali also looked southward, into Sudan: in the early 1820s, a series of campaigns saw Egyptian forces overcoming the Funj sultanate, as well as the last remnants of Mameluke opposition. In 1824, the Egyptian capital was established at Khartoum, where the Blue and White Niles meet. Further southward incursions would continue in the decades to come, toward Kordofan and into the Nuba mountains, while Khartoum-based traders and soldiers would reach as far as the lacustrine kingdoms of East Africa by the 1860s and 1870s; Egyptian rule of Sudan was only shattered by the Mahdist revolt in the 1880s, examined in Chapter 7. Importantly, the Egyptian presence in both Sudan and the Red Sea facilitated an <b>expansion</b> of trade, with many becoming rich on the proceeds of the regional slave and ivory trades along the Nile, fed by incursions into south Sudan, and the eastward-bound commerce on the Red Sea, increasingly used by Europeans as a route to India and East Asia. Egyptian <b>expansion</b> in Sudan would also lead to conflict with the other great expanding state in the region, namely Ethiopia under emperors Tewodros and Yohannes. In time, it was the commercial and strategic importance of the Red Sea to the British in particular which would be the undoing of the independent Egypt created by Muhammad Ali – and for this reason he consistently opposed the building of a canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean; but even before this, he was a cause for concern in European capitals, where he was perceived as becoming over-mighty and a threat to stability in the region. The British, moreover, had committed themselves to the defense and maintenance of the ever-weakening Ottoman empire, and Muhammad Ali needed to be brought to heel. It was Muhammad Ali’s <b>expansion</b> into the Levant in the early 1830s that caused great anxiety in Istanbul: an Ottoman expedition dispatched in 1839 to wrest the provinces of Syria and Palestine from Egyptian control ended in defeat and humiliation for the sultan, at which point Britain and several European allies stepped in to force Muhammad Ali to withdraw. In the late 1830s and early 1840s, he had his wings clipped even further when he was forced to reduce the size of his army – from close to 200,000 men to some 18,000 – and to end the monopolies he had set up which excluded Europeans from Egyptian markets.

In time, it was the commercial and strategic importance of the Red Sea to the British in particular which would be the undoing of the independent Egypt created by Muhammad Ali – and for this reason he consistently opposed the building of a canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean; but even before this, he was a cause for concern in European capitals, where he was perceived as becoming over-mighty and a threat to stability in the region. The British, moreover, had committed themselves to the defense and maintenance of the ever-weakening Ottoman empire, and Muhammad Ali needed to be brought to heel. It was Muhammad Ali’s <b>expansion</b> into the Levant in the early 1830s that caused great anxiety in Istanbul: an Ottoman expedition dispatched in 1839 to wrest the provinces of Syria and Palestine from Egyptian control ended in defeat and humiliation for the sultan, at which point Britain and several European allies stepped in to force Muhammad Ali to withdraw. In the late 1830s and early 1840s, he had his wings clipped even further when he was forced to reduce the size of his army – from close to 200,000 men to some 18,000 – and to end the monopolies he had set up which excluded Europeans from Egyptian markets. This effectively ended Muhammad Ali’s industrial ambitions, and from the 1840s onward the Egyptian economy became both largely agricultural and exposed to ever greater European influence and indeed management. The Egypt he had created was only partially “modernized,” limited by European wariness of this “oriental despot” and prone to European intervention; it was a pattern which was repeated across Islamic North Africa, and ultimately caused a profound cleavage within Islam itself.        In the meantime, Muhammad Ali also looked southward, into Sudan: in the early 1820s, a series of campaigns saw Egyptian forces overcoming the Funj sultanate, as well as the last remnants of Mameluke opposition. In 1824, the Egyptian capital was established at Khartoum, where the Blue and White Niles meet. Further southward incursions would continue in the decades to come, toward Kordofan and into the Nuba mountains, while Khartoum-based traders and soldiers would reach as far as the lacustrine kingdoms of East Africa by the 1860s and 1870s; Egyptian rule of Sudan was only shattered by the Mahdist revolt in the 1880s, examined in Chapter 7.

This effectively ended Muhammad Ali’s industrial ambitions, and from the 1840s onward the Egyptian economy became both largely agricultural and exposed to ever greater European influence and indeed management. The Egypt he had created was only partially “modernized,” limited by European wariness of this “oriental despot” and prone to European intervention; it was a pattern which was repeated across Islamic North Africa, and ultimately caused a profound cleavage within Islam itself.        In the meantime, Muhammad Ali also looked southward, into Sudan: in the early 1820s, a series of campaigns saw Egyptian forces overcoming the Funj sultanate, as well as the last remnants of Mameluke opposition. In 1824, the Egyptian capital was established at Khartoum, where the Blue and White Niles meet. Further southward incursions would continue in the decades to come, toward Kordofan and into the Nuba mountains, while Khartoum-based traders and soldiers would reach as far as the lacustrine kingdoms of East Africa by the 1860s and 1870s; Egyptian rule of Sudan was only shattered by the Mahdist revolt in the 1880s, examined in Chapter 7. Importantly, the Egyptian presence in both Sudan and the Red Sea facilitated an <b>expansion</b> of trade, with many becoming rich on the proceeds of the regional slave and ivory trades along the Nile, fed by incursions into south Sudan, and the eastward-bound commerce on the Red Sea, increasingly used by Europeans as a route to India and East Asia. Egyptian <b>expansion</b> in Sudan would also lead to conflict with the other great expanding state in the region, namely Ethiopia under emperors Tewodros and Yohannes. In time, it was the commercial and strategic importance of the Red Sea to the British in particular which would be the undoing of the independent Egypt created by Muhammad Ali – and for this reason he consistently opposed the building of a canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean; but even before this, he was a cause for concern in European capitals, where he was perceived as becoming over-mighty and a threat to stability in the region. The British, moreover, had committed themselves to the defense and maintenance of the ever-weakening Ottoman empire, and Muhammad Ali needed to be brought to heel.

Further southward incursions would continue in the decades to come, toward Kordofan and into the Nuba mountains, while Khartoum-based traders and soldiers would reach as far as the lacustrine kingdoms of East Africa by the 1860s and 1870s; Egyptian rule of Sudan was only shattered by the Mahdist revolt in the 1880s, examined in Chapter 7. Importantly, the Egyptian presence in both Sudan and the Red Sea facilitated an <b>expansion</b> of trade, with many becoming rich on the proceeds of the regional slave and ivory trades along the Nile, fed by incursions into south Sudan, and the eastward-bound commerce on the Red Sea, increasingly used by Europeans as a route to India and East Asia. Egyptian <b>expansion</b> in Sudan would also lead to conflict with the other great expanding state in the region, namely Ethiopia under emperors Tewodros and Yohannes. In time, it was the commercial and strategic importance of the Red Sea to the British in particular which would be the undoing of the independent Egypt created by Muhammad Ali – and for this reason he consistently opposed the building of a canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean; but even before this, he was a cause for concern in European capitals, where he was perceived as becoming over-mighty and a threat to stability in the region. The British, moreover, had committed themselves to the defense and maintenance of the ever-weakening Ottoman empire, and Muhammad Ali needed to be brought to heel. It was Muhammad Ali’s <b>expansion</b> into the Levant in the early 1830s that caused great anxiety in Istanbul: an Ottoman expedition dispatched in 1839 to wrest the provinces of Syria and Palestine from Egyptian control ended in defeat and humiliation for the sultan, at which point Britain and several European allies stepped in to force Muhammad Ali to withdraw. In the late 1830s and early 1840s, he had his wings clipped even further when he was forced to reduce the size of his army – from close to 200,000 men to some 18,000 – and to end the monopolies he had set up which excluded Europeans from Egyptian markets. This effectively ended Muhammad Ali’s industrial ambitions, and from the 1840s onward the Egyptian economy became both largely agricultural and exposed to ever greater European influence and indeed management. The Egypt he had created was only partially “modernized,” limited by European wariness of this “oriental despot” and prone to European intervention; it was a pattern which was repeated across Islamic North Africa, and ultimately caused a profound cleavage within Islam itself.

It was Muhammad Ali’s <b>expansion</b> into the Levant in the early 1830s that caused great anxiety in Istanbul: an Ottoman expedition dispatched in 1839 to wrest the provinces of Syria and Palestine from Egyptian control ended in defeat and humiliation for the sultan, at which point Britain and several European allies stepped in to force Muhammad Ali to withdraw. In the late 1830s and early 1840s, he had his wings clipped even further when he was forced to reduce the size of his army – from close to 200,000 men to some 18,000 – and to end the monopolies he had set up which excluded Europeans from Egyptian markets. This effectively ended Muhammad Ali’s industrial ambitions, and from the 1840s onward the Egyptian economy became both largely agricultural and exposed to ever greater European influence and indeed management. The Egypt he had created was only partially “modernized,” limited by European wariness of this “oriental despot” and prone to European intervention; it was a pattern which was repeated across Islamic North Africa, and ultimately caused a profound cleavage within Islam itself.        In the meantime, Muhammad Ali also looked southward, into Sudan: in the early 1820s, a series of campaigns saw Egyptian forces overcoming the Funj sultanate, as well as the last remnants of Mameluke opposition. In 1824, the Egyptian capital was established at Khartoum, where the Blue and White Niles meet. Further southward incursions would continue in the decades to come, toward Kordofan and into the Nuba mountains, while Khartoum-based traders and soldiers would reach as far as the lacustrine kingdoms of East Africa by the 1860s and 1870s; Egyptian rule of Sudan was only shattered by the Mahdist revolt in the 1880s, examined in Chapter 7. Importantly, the Egyptian presence in both Sudan and the Red Sea facilitated an <b>expansion</b> of trade, with many becoming rich on the proceeds of the regional slave and ivory trades along the Nile, fed by incursions into south Sudan, and the eastward-bound commerce on the Red Sea, increasingly used by Europeans as a route to India and East Asia.

In the meantime, Muhammad Ali also looked southward, into Sudan: in the early 1820s, a series of campaigns saw Egyptian forces overcoming the Funj sultanate, as well as the last remnants of Mameluke opposition. In 1824, the Egyptian capital was established at Khartoum, where the Blue and White Niles meet. Further southward incursions would continue in the decades to come, toward Kordofan and into the Nuba mountains, while Khartoum-based traders and soldiers would reach as far as the lacustrine kingdoms of East Africa by the 1860s and 1870s; Egyptian rule of Sudan was only shattered by the Mahdist revolt in the 1880s, examined in Chapter 7. Importantly, the Egyptian presence in both Sudan and the Red Sea facilitated an <b>expansion</b> of trade, with many becoming rich on the proceeds of the regional slave and ivory trades along the Nile, fed by incursions into south Sudan, and the eastward-bound commerce on the Red Sea, increasingly used by Europeans as a route to India and East Asia. Egyptian <b>expansion</b> in Sudan would also lead to conflict with the other great expanding state in the region, namely Ethiopia under emperors Tewodros and Yohannes. In time, it was the commercial and strategic importance of the Red Sea to the British in particular which would be the undoing of the independent Egypt created by Muhammad Ali – and for this reason he consistently opposed the building of a canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean; but even before this, he was a cause for concern in European capitals, where he was perceived as becoming over-mighty and a threat to stability in the region. The British, moreover, had committed themselves to the defense and maintenance of the ever-weakening Ottoman empire, and Muhammad Ali needed to be brought to heel. It was Muhammad Ali’s <b>expansion</b> into the Levant in the early 1830s that caused great anxiety in Istanbul: an Ottoman expedition dispatched in 1839 to wrest the provinces of Syria and Palestine from Egyptian control ended in defeat and humiliation for the sultan, at which point Britain and several European allies stepped in to force Muhammad Ali to withdraw. In the late 1830s and early 1840s, he had his wings clipped even further when he was forced to reduce the size of his army – from close to 200,000 men to some 18,000 – and to end the monopolies he had set up which excluded Europeans from Egyptian markets.

In time, it was the commercial and strategic importance of the Red Sea to the British in particular which would be the undoing of the independent Egypt created by Muhammad Ali – and for this reason he consistently opposed the building of a canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean; but even before this, he was a cause for concern in European capitals, where he was perceived as becoming over-mighty and a threat to stability in the region. The British, moreover, had committed themselves to the defense and maintenance of the ever-weakening Ottoman empire, and Muhammad Ali needed to be brought to heel. It was Muhammad Ali’s <b>expansion</b> into the Levant in the early 1830s that caused great anxiety in Istanbul: an Ottoman expedition dispatched in 1839 to wrest the provinces of Syria and Palestine from Egyptian control ended in defeat and humiliation for the sultan, at which point Britain and several European allies stepped in to force Muhammad Ali to withdraw. In the late 1830s and early 1840s, he had his wings clipped even further when he was forced to reduce the size of his army – from close to 200,000 men to some 18,000 – and to end the monopolies he had set up which excluded Europeans from Egyptian markets. This effectively ended Muhammad Ali’s industrial ambitions, and from the 1840s onward the Egyptian economy became both largely agricultural and exposed to ever greater European influence and indeed management. The Egypt he had created was only partially “modernized,” limited by European wariness of this “oriental despot” and prone to European intervention; it was a pattern which was repeated across Islamic North Africa, and ultimately caused a profound cleavage within Islam itself.        In the meantime, Muhammad Ali also looked southward, into Sudan: in the early 1820s, a series of campaigns saw Egyptian forces overcoming the Funj sultanate, as well as the last remnants of Mameluke opposition. In 1824, the Egyptian capital was established at Khartoum, where the Blue and White Niles meet. Further southward incursions would continue in the decades to come, toward Kordofan and into the Nuba mountains, while Khartoum-based traders and soldiers would reach as far as the lacustrine kingdoms of East Africa by the 1860s and 1870s; Egyptian rule of Sudan was only shattered by the Mahdist revolt in the 1880s, examined in Chapter 7.

This effectively ended Muhammad Ali’s industrial ambitions, and from the 1840s onward the Egyptian economy became both largely agricultural and exposed to ever greater European influence and indeed management. The Egypt he had created was only partially “modernized,” limited by European wariness of this “oriental despot” and prone to European intervention; it was a pattern which was repeated across Islamic North Africa, and ultimately caused a profound cleavage within Islam itself.        In the meantime, Muhammad Ali also looked southward, into Sudan: in the early 1820s, a series of campaigns saw Egyptian forces overcoming the Funj sultanate, as well as the last remnants of Mameluke opposition. In 1824, the Egyptian capital was established at Khartoum, where the Blue and White Niles meet. Further southward incursions would continue in the decades to come, toward Kordofan and into the Nuba mountains, while Khartoum-based traders and soldiers would reach as far as the lacustrine kingdoms of East Africa by the 1860s and 1870s; Egyptian rule of Sudan was only shattered by the Mahdist revolt in the 1880s, examined in Chapter 7. Importantly, the Egyptian presence in both Sudan and the Red Sea facilitated an <b>expansion</b> of trade, with many becoming rich on the proceeds of the regional slave and ivory trades along the Nile, fed by incursions into south Sudan, and the eastward-bound commerce on the Red Sea, increasingly used by Europeans as a route to India and East Asia. Egyptian <b>expansion</b> in Sudan would also lead to conflict with the other great expanding state in the region, namely Ethiopia under emperors Tewodros and Yohannes. In time, it was the commercial and strategic importance of the Red Sea to the British in particular which would be the undoing of the independent Egypt created by Muhammad Ali – and for this reason he consistently opposed the building of a canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean; but even before this, he was a cause for concern in European capitals, where he was perceived as becoming over-mighty and a threat to stability in the region. The British, moreover, had committed themselves to the defense and maintenance of the ever-weakening Ottoman empire, and Muhammad Ali needed to be brought to heel.

Further southward incursions would continue in the decades to come, toward Kordofan and into the Nuba mountains, while Khartoum-based traders and soldiers would reach as far as the lacustrine kingdoms of East Africa by the 1860s and 1870s; Egyptian rule of Sudan was only shattered by the Mahdist revolt in the 1880s, examined in Chapter 7. Importantly, the Egyptian presence in both Sudan and the Red Sea facilitated an <b>expansion</b> of trade, with many becoming rich on the proceeds of the regional slave and ivory trades along the Nile, fed by incursions into south Sudan, and the eastward-bound commerce on the Red Sea, increasingly used by Europeans as a route to India and East Asia. Egyptian <b>expansion</b> in Sudan would also lead to conflict with the other great expanding state in the region, namely Ethiopia under emperors Tewodros and Yohannes. In time, it was the commercial and strategic importance of the Red Sea to the British in particular which would be the undoing of the independent Egypt created by Muhammad Ali – and for this reason he consistently opposed the building of a canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean; but even before this, he was a cause for concern in European capitals, where he was perceived as becoming over-mighty and a threat to stability in the region. The British, moreover, had committed themselves to the defense and maintenance of the ever-weakening Ottoman empire, and Muhammad Ali needed to be brought to heel. It was Muhammad Ali’s <b>expansion</b> into the Levant in the early 1830s that caused great anxiety in Istanbul: an Ottoman expedition dispatched in 1839 to wrest the provinces of Syria and Palestine from Egyptian control ended in defeat and humiliation for the sultan, at which point Britain and several European allies stepped in to force Muhammad Ali to withdraw. In the late 1830s and early 1840s, he had his wings clipped even further when he was forced to reduce the size of his army – from close to 200,000 men to some 18,000 – and to end the monopolies he had set up which excluded Europeans from Egyptian markets. This effectively ended Muhammad Ali’s industrial ambitions, and from the 1840s onward the Egyptian economy became both largely agricultural and exposed to ever greater European influence and indeed management. The Egypt he had created was only partially “modernized,” limited by European wariness of this “oriental despot” and prone to European intervention; it was a pattern which was repeated across Islamic North Africa, and ultimately caused a profound cleavage within Islam itself.

The British, moreover, to stability in the the defense and maintenance had committed themselves to empire, and Muhammad Ali of the ever-weakening Ottoman to heel. It was needed to be brought the Levant in the Muhammad Ali’s <b>expansion</b> into great anxiety in Istanbul: early 1830s that caused in 1839 to wrest an Ottoman expedition dispatched and Palestine from Egyptian the provinces of Syria and humiliation for the control ended in defeat Britain and several European sultan, at which point force Muhammad Ali to allies stepped in to 1830s and early 1840s, withdraw.

Muhammad Ali also looked  In the meantime, the early 1820s, a southward, into Sudan: in Egyptian forces overcoming the series of campaigns saw as the last remnants Funj sultanate, as well 1824, the Egyptian capital of Mameluke opposition. In where the Blue and was established at Khartoum, southward incursions would continue White Niles meet.

In his wings clipped even early 1840s, he had forced to reduce the further when he was – from close to size of his army 18,000 – and to 200,000 men to some had set up which end the monopolies he markets. This effectively ended excluded Europeans from Egyptian and from the 1840s Muhammad Ali’s industrial ambitions, became both largely agricultural onward the Egyptian economy greater European influence and and exposed to ever he had created was indeed management. The Egypt by European wariness of only partially “modernized,” limited prone to European intervention; this “oriental despot” and which was repeated across it was a pattern ultimately caused a profound Islamic North Africa, and     cleavage within Islam itself. the meantime, Muhammad Ali    In Sudan: in the early also looked southward, into campaigns saw Egyptian forces 1820s, a series of as well as the overcoming the Funj sultanate, opposition.
